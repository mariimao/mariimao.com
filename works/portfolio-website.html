            <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
            <p>
                During the summer of 2024, I did a work study as a Web Assistant for the <a href="https://communications.utoronto.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Toronto Communications</a> team. 
                Wanting to put what I learned to use, I decided to cocurrently work on this personal website. 
                My goal was to create a space that felt personal and fun, while ensuring that it was accessible and easy to navigate.
            </p>
            <ul class="overview-summary">
                <li><strong>Role:</strong><br>Designer, Developer</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline:</strong><br>4 months</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong><br> Figma, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Netlify</li>
                <li><strong>Team:</strong><br> Independent</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>
                My target audience for this website was <strong>recruiters</strong> and potential <strong>collaborators</strong> in the design and tech industry.
                They want portfolios that are <i>easy to scan</i> and provide a clear overview of the designer's skills and experience.
            </p>     
            <h4>User Persona</h4>
            <table class="user-persona-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>

                <tr>
                    <th>Background</th>
                    <td>Alex has been working as a recruiter for the past 10 years. They are tech-savvy, comfortable navigating various online platforms, and accustomed to reviewing portfolios quickly.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Goals</th>
                    <td>Find a UI/UX designer with a strong portfolio that demonstrates both creative and technical skills. Does not have a lot of time to spend on a portfolio.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Opportunity areas</th>
                    <td>Short, impactful portfolio pieces with clear visuals. Well-written case studies that explain the designerâ€™s thought process, challenges faced, and solutions. Easily accessible contact information.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
            <p>
                I started by looking at the websites of other designers and developers to see what they included and how they presented their work.
                I found that many of them had a clean and minimalistic design, with a focus on their portfolio and resume.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also decided to look at websites of some of my favourite artists to see how they incorporate their creativity into their websites.
                I found that many of them used bright colours, fun and interactive animations, and many unique elements. 
                They also focused on showcasing each piece of their work and had a newsfeed or blog to keep their audience updated.
            </p>

            <h2>Implementation & Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Creating this website was a great learning experience for me. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive website.
                I also learned how to optimize websites for performance, accessibility, and the search engine (SEO).
            </p>
            <p>
                While developing this website, I got quality feedback from my peers and mentors. I used this feedback to improve the website and make it more user-friendly.
                I also learned how to use Google Analytics 4 to track its performance such as using metrics like the bounce rate. 
            </p>

            <!-- usability testing? -->

            <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>a blog section</li>
                <li>more interactive elements with better animations</li>
                <li>more case studies</li>
                <li>if I need to, I might consider transferring to a CSM like wordpress or Drupal.</li>
