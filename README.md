Hello, this is a repository for my personal website/portfolio.

This was designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/2cFmdwtT68OU9hhWIS0rUU/website?node-id=239-10&t=BDcaN82ZKpvQQIOj-1), built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and deployed using Netlify. 

I spent a long time learning how to create and implement different aspects of a website. Some things I've learned along the way:

- Deploying a website
- Getting a domain
- Lighthouse reports
- Sitemaps and robot.txt
- Open Graph meta tags
- Schema.org markup
- use of HTML tags and header tags for SEO
- Designing icons and materials with Figma
- Implementing darkmode with JavaScript
- Responsive design
- Bootstrap formatting
- Hamburger menus
- 404 pages and other error pages
- Cubic bezier functions and animations

I had a lot of fun making this even though it was a challenge. There are still some parts I need to fix, but I will get to that eventually.

Thank you for checking out my website and taking the time to read this :D
